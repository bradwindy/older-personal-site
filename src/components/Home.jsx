                  Development Experience
                </h5>
                I have gained experience and abilities in a wide range of areas
                in development throughout my time at University, including
                Javascript, NodeJS, C, SQL, Java, and Python. This also includes
                experience with design patterns and architectures such as
                RESTful APIâ€™s, MVC and TDD. Through a Microsoft Student
                Accelerator program I participated in, I have gained skills in
                Asp.net, C#, React, Javascript and the Azure cloud platform.
                <br />
                <br />I have developed multiple web apps using the{" "}
                <b>MERN stack</b> and I have plenty of full stack devlelopment
                experience.
                <br />
                <br />I have also developed <b>two android apps</b> using the
                Flutter framework, both available on the Play Store.

                <p className="card-text">
                  In two group projects within university we used the agile
                  development method <b>scrum</b>, and worked in sprints to
                  develop our software. This methodology allowed us to work
                  closely with the client and repeatedly iterate on the
                  deliverable to produce the final product.

                  In my third year of university I worked in two team

                  communicate with others and how to develop in a team
